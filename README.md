# fast-human-3-animations
I am going to make a quick person (or humanoid) character in blender. Then define three animations (idle, jump, walk) for use in a game prototype. Watch and follow along with me if you like.

The video is long, but its a process. And you get to see me go thru it. Making the simple model / adding the bones & IK / then adding three animations (idle, jump, walk)
